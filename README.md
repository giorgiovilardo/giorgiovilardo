Hi, I'm Giorgio!

I work at [Casavo](https://www.casavo.it/) as a software engineer. We're out to revolutionize, disrupt and modernize the housing market!

I like Python (I'm a fluent parseltongue), functional languages, building things and I'm at my best when I enable others in doing their job better.

Find me on twitter at [@gviwastaken](https://www.twitter.com/gviwastaken).

Below you'll find my "study plan" for technical activities in 2023.
Feel free to suggest me stuff to read and learn about.
Open a [discussion](https://github.com/giorgiovilardo/giorgiovilardo/discussions), hit me with a PR, or contact me (you know how, since I'm probably the only one reading this).

### Learning list 2023

Still brewing, as I have even less time than 2022
