Hi, I'm Giorgio!

I work at [Claranet Italy](https://www.claranet.it/) as a software developer.

I'm a parseltongue as I mainly speak Python :) but I'm trying to expand my knowledge towards functional languages.

### Want-to-read/learn/do list of 2021, in random order

- [ ] [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)
- [ ] Finish, if possible due to knowledge, Agile Technical Practices Distilled: A Journey Toward Mastering Software Design
- [ ] SICP
- [ ] The Little Schemer
- [ ] [Functional Programming in OCaml](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019sp/textbook/)
- [ ] Probably something about F# (TBD)
- [ ] Probably something about Elixir (TBD)
- [ ] Join/start a technical book club (very farfeteched)
- [ ] Learn spanish (straight outta 2019's good intention. and this year even more farfetched than book club)
