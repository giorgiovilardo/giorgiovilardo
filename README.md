Hi, I'm Giorgio!

I work at ~~[Claranet Italy](https://www.claranet.it/)~~ as a software engineer.

I like Python (I'm a fluent parseltongue), functional languages, building things and I'm at my best when I enable others in doing their job better.

Find me on twitter at [@gviwastaken](https://www.twitter.com/gviwastaken).

Below you'll find my "study plan" for technical activities in 2022.
Feel free to suggest me stuff to read and learn about.
Open a [discussion](https://github.com/giorgiovilardo/giorgiovilardo/discussions), hit me with a PR, or contact me (you know how, since I'm probably the only one reading this).

### Learning list 2022

[Moved to here!](https://giorgiovilardo.notion.site/Learning-List-2022-cd167297a89d4343bedc8b13d13c6e5f)

### Tentative learning list of 2022 (still need to move stuff over to Notion)

- [ ] Keep up with functional stuff (F#, Haskell/Purescript/w.e., Elixir, SICP, FP in OCaml and so on)
- [ ] Event driven thingies, event sourcing, experiment with these kind of things?
- [ ] Databases deep dive, mainly Postgresql?
- [ ] Video technologies (codecs, ffmpeg, ffmpeg + custom software, HLS, video streaming, and so on)?
- [ ] Go deeper in .NET? Hard without examples of best practices and without working on it
- [ ] node? maybe it's time!
- [ ] Soul search for something that exploits my strengths (dev advocacy?)
