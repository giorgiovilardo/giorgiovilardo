Hi, I'm Giorgio!

I work at ~~[Claranet Italy](https://www.claranet.it/)~~ as a software engineer.

I like Python (I'm a fluent parseltongue), functional languages, building things and I'm at my best when I enable others in doing their job better.

Find me on twitter at [@gviwastaken](https://www.twitter.com/gviwastaken).

Below you'll find my "study plan" for technical activities in 2022.
Feel free to suggest me stuff to read and learn about.
Open a [discussion](https://github.com/giorgiovilardo/giorgiovilardo/discussions), hit me with a PR, or contact me (you know how, since I'm probably the only one reading this).

### Tentative learning list of 2022

- [ ] Keep up with functional stuff (F#, Haskell/Purescript/w.e., Elixir, SICP, FP in OCaml and so on)
- [ ] Event driven thingies, event sourcing, experiment with these kind of things?
- [ ] Databases deep dive, mainly Postgresql?
- [ ] Video technologies (codecs, ffmpeg, ffmpeg + custom software, HLS, video streaming, and so on)?
- [ ] Go deeper in .NET? Hard without examples of best practices and without working on it
- [ ] Soul search for something that exploits my strengths (dev advocacy?)

### Continuous learning list of 2021, in random order and to be expanded

#### Sure

- [x] Produce an heir
- [x] Partecipate in the F# mentorship program 
- [x] Read `Domain Modeling Made Functional` (cheat: didn't actually properly finished it, but it's good as done)
- [x] Partecipate at Scott Wlaschin's workshop (fuck yes) (waiting for it!!)
- [X] Got decent at F# and started to understanding more functional stuff 

#### Improbable

- [x] Probably something about F# (done: the great "F# from the ground up", pretty useful as a first foray into the lang)
- [x] Finish, Agile Technical Practices Distilled: A Journey Toward Mastering Software Design
- [ ] [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)
- [ ] [Functional Programming in OCaml 2020 edition](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020sp/textbook/)

#### Impossible

- [ ] [Learn something about Purescript](https://book.purescript.org/index.html)
- [ ] Join/start a technical book club (very farfeteched)
- [ ] Learn spanish (straight outta 2019's good intention. and this year even more farfetched than book club)
- [ ] SICP
- [ ] The Little Schemer
