Hi, I'm Giorgio!

I work at [Claranet Italy](https://www.claranet.it/) as a software developer.

I'm a parseltongue as I mainly speak Python :) but I'm trying to expand my knowledge towards functional languages.

Below you'll find my "study plan" for technical activities in 2021.
Feel free to suggest me stuff to read and learn about.
Open a [discussion](https://github.com/giorgiovilardo/giorgiovilardo/discussions), hit me with a PR, or contact me (you know how, since I'm probably the only one reading this).

### Continuous learning list of 2021, in random order and to be expanded

#### Probable

- [ ] [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)
- [ ] Finish, if possible due to knowledge, Agile Technical Practices Distilled: A Journey Toward Mastering Software Design
- [ ] SICP
- [ ] The Little Schemer
- [ ] [Functional Programming in OCaml 2020 edition](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020sp/textbook/)
- [ ] Probably something about F# (TBD)
- [ ] Probably something about Elixir (TBD)
- [ ] https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms

#### Improbable

- [ ] [Learn something about Purescript](https://book.purescript.org/index.html)
- [ ] Join/start a technical book club (very farfeteched)
- [ ] Learn spanish (straight outta 2019's good intention. and this year even more farfetched than book club)
