Hi, I'm Giorgio!

I work at ~~[Claranet Italy](https://www.claranet.it/)~~ as a software engineer.

I like Python (I'm a fluent parseltongue), functional languages, building things and I'm at my best when I enable others in doing their job better.

Find me on twitter at [@gviwastaken](https://www.twitter.com/gviwastaken).

Below you'll find my "study plan" for technical activities in 2022.
Feel free to suggest me stuff to read and learn about.
Open a [discussion](https://github.com/giorgiovilardo/giorgiovilardo/discussions), hit me with a PR, or contact me (you know how, since I'm probably the only one reading this).
